  abstract  = {Many document classification applications require
               human understanding of the reasons for data-driven
               classification decisions by managers, client-facing employees,
               and the technical team. Predictive models
               treat documents as data to be classified, and document data are
               characterized by very high dimensionality,
               often with tens of thousands to millions of variables (words).
               Unfortunately, due to the high
               dimensionality, understanding the decisions made by document
               classifiers is very difficult. This paper
               begins by extending the most relevant prior theoretical model of
               explanations for intelligent systems to
               account for some missing elements. The main theoretical
               contribution is the definition of a new sort of
               explanation as a minimal set of words (terms, generally), such
               that removing all words within this set
               from the document changes the predicted class from the class of
               interest. We present an algorithm to
               find such explanations, as well as a framework to assess such an
               algorithm’s performance. We demonstrate
               the value of the new approach with a case study from a real-world
               document classification task:
               classifying web pages as containing objectionable content, with
               the goal of allowing advertisers to
               choose not to have their ads appear on those pages. A second
               empirical demonstration on news-story
               topic classification shows the explanations to be concise and
               document-specific, and to be capable of
               providing understanding of the exact reasons for the
               classification decisions, of the workings of the
               classification models, and of the business application itself. We
               also illustrate how explaining the
               classifications of documents can help to improve data quality and
               model performance.},

  abstract = { Mobile device proficiency is increasingly required to
              participate in society. Unfortunately, there still exists a digital
              divide between younger and older adults, especially with respect to
              mobile devices (i.e., tablet computers and smartphones). Training
              is an important goal to ensure that older adults can reap the
              benefits of these devices. However, efficient/effective training
              depends on the ability to gauge current proficiency levels. We
              developed a new scale to accurately assess the mobile device
              proficiency of older adults: the Mobile Device Proficiency
              Questionnaire (MDPQ). We present and validate the MDPQ and a short
              16-question version of the MDPQ (MDPQ-16). The MDPQ, its subscales,
              and the MDPQ-16 were found to be highly reliable and valid measures
              of mobile device proficiency in a large sample. We conclude that
              the MDPQ and MDPQ-16 may serve as useful tools for facilitating
              mobile device training of older adults and measuring mobile device
              proficiency for research purposes. }

               Digital Competence Framework for Citizens. It describes
               knowledge, skills and attitudes that are needed to be digitally
               competent for daily life, participation
               in society, working and learning. The framework is
               technology-neutral and is designed to be tailored and
               adapted for a variety of purposes in education, training and
               employment contexts. The framework update
               reflects rapid digital technological developments that have
               occurred since 2022 and which have
               wide-ranging implications for digital competence. DigComp 3.0
               includes new learning outcomes which
               provide a more granular view of digital competence than
               previously, as well as the systematic and
               transversal integration of AI across the framework. It supports
               EU policies and initiatives on digital
               skills (such as the Union of Skills and the Digital Decade Policy
               Programme) and the societal and
               economic implications of the digital transformation (such as the
               AI Continent Action Plan and the
               European Strategy for a Better Internet for Kids). It is intended
               for individuals and organisations,
               whether local, regional, national, European or international, who
               share the common goal of understanding
               and identifying digital skills needs and supporting their development.},
