  abstract  = {Many document classification applications require human understanding of the reasons for data-driven 
               classification decisions by managers, client-facing employees, and the technical team. Predictive models 
               treat documents as data to be classified, and document data are characterized by very high dimensionality,
               often with tens of thousands to millions of variables (words). Unfortunately, due to the high 
               dimensionality, understanding the decisions made by document classifiers is very difficult. This paper 
               begins by extending the most relevant prior theoretical model of explanations for intelligent systems to
               account for some missing elements. The main theoretical contribution is the definition of a new sort of 
               explanation as a minimal set of words (terms, generally), such that removing all words within this set 
               from the document changes the predicted class from the class of interest. We present an algorithm to 
               find such explanations, as well as a framework to assess such an algorithm’s performance. We demonstrate
               the value of the new approach with a case study from a real-world document classification task: 
               classifying web pages as containing objectionable content, with the goal of allowing advertisers to 
               choose not to have their ads appear on those pages. A second empirical demonstration on news-story 
               topic classification shows the explanations to be concise and document-specific, and to be capable of 
               providing understanding of the exact reasons for the classification decisions, of the workings of the 
               classification models, and of the business application itself. We also illustrate how explaining the 
               classifications of documents can help to improve data quality and model performance.},

  abstract = { Mobile device proficiency is increasingly required to participate in society. Unfortunately, there still exists a digital divide between younger and older adults, especially with respect to mobile devices (i.e., tablet computers and smartphones). Training is an important goal to ensure that older adults can reap the benefits of these devices. However, efficient/effective training depends on the ability to gauge current proficiency levels. We developed a new scale to accurately assess the mobile device proficiency of older adults: the Mobile Device Proficiency Questionnaire (MDPQ). We present and validate the MDPQ and a short 16-question version of the MDPQ (MDPQ-16). The MDPQ, its subscales, and the MDPQ-16 were found to be highly reliable and valid measures of mobile device proficiency in a large sample. We conclude that the MDPQ and MDPQ-16 may serve as useful tools for facilitating mobile device training of older adults and measuring mobile device proficiency for research purposes. }

  abstract = {Background: The need for digital literacy in aging populations is increasing in the digitalizing society. Digital literacy involves the identification, evaluation, and communication of information through various digital devices or relevant programs. Objective: The aims of this study were to develop an Everyday Digital Literacy Questionnaire (EDLQ), a digital literacy assessment scale, and subsequently evaluate its psychometric properties using a population of community-dwelling older adults in South Korea. Methods: The EDLQ was developed using an instrument development design. A nationwide survey was conducted, and the study included 1016 community-dwelling older adults (age ≥60 years). To evaluate the psychometric properties, the participants were randomly divided into 2 groups (n=508 each), and the internal consistency (Cronbach $\alpha$ and McDonald $\omega$), structural validity (exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis), hypothesis-testing construct validity using the eHealth Literacy Scale (eHEALS), and measurement invariance were analyzed. Results: Among the initial 30 items of the EDLQ, 22 items with a 3-factor solution had a total explained variance of 77{\%}. The domains included ``information and communication'' (9 items), ``content creation and management'' (4 items), and ``safety and security'' (9 items). Confirmatory factor analysis was conducted with this 3-factor solution ($\chi$2206=345.1; normed $\chi$2206=1.7; comparative fit index=0.997; Tucker-Lewis index=0.997; root-mean-square error of approximation=0.036; standardized root-mean-square residual=0.050; composite reliability=0.903-0.959; average variance extracted=0.699-0.724; R2=0.616-0.773). Hypothesis-testing construct validity with the eHEALS revealed a strong correlation (r=0.75). Cronbach $\alpha$ and McDonald $\omega$ coefficients were .98 and 0.98, respectively. The fit indices for measurement invariance, including the configural, metric, and scalar invariance models, demonstrated a satisfactory fit to the data. Our findings suggest that the psychometric properties of the 22-item EDLQ are valid and reliable for assessing digital literacy among older Korean adults. Conclusions: In this study, we developed a digital literacy measure with strong psychometric properties that made it suitable for assessing the digital literacy of community-dwelling older adults in Korea. To broaden its applicability, however, further assessment of its feasibility for use with different languages and cultures is necessary. Moreover, more empirical research on digital literacy and related factors in older adults can facilitate the development of personalized digital health care services and educational interventions in the digital society. },

               reflects rapid digital technological developments that have occurred since 2022 and which have 
               wide-ranging implications for digital competence. DigComp 3.0 includes new learning outcomes which 
               provide a more granular view of digital competence than previously, as well as the systematic and 
               transversal integration of AI across the framework. It supports EU policies and initiatives on digital
