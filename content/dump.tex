In 2019, the level of digitalization in German businesses was perceived to be
negatively affected by the amount of IT specialists available in the market.
\cite{leifels2020digitalization}.

In 2024, 60\% of the companies in Germany saw the lack of time for training as
one of the biggest impediments for digitalisation
(\cite{2025GermanyDigitalisationReport}). This statistic has been one of the
most prominent reasons in the last few years, being reported as the number one
internal factor from 2022 until the time of writing
(\cite{2023GermanyDigitalisationReport}).
